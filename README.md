# Summary

This is a simple Golang-based implementation for creating Kubernetes dynamic.Interface 
configurations for cloud providers, using native IAM constructs for the given cloud 
provider.

## Motivation

More or less, this is simply a reminder of how I was able to create clients and interact 
with various cloud providers like EKS and GKE with Golang used for programattic access 
to the clusters.

**NOTE:** at this time this project is lightly tested and used more for remembering how to 
do such things.  At the point in which there is interest to put more effort into maintaining I
am happy to maintain.
